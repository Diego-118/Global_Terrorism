# 🎓 Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis

## 🔍 About This Project
Terrorism is one of the most complex and devastating challenges of our time. In this project, we go beyond the headlines and dive into a massive dataset of global terrorist attacks. Using SQL and Python, we've uncovered surprising patterns: Where does terrorism strike the hardest? Which weapons cause the most harm? Who are the main perpetrators?

If you're curious about the real human impact of terrorism, or want to see how data analysis can bring global issues into sharp focus, you're in the right place.

## 📊 What’s in the Dataset?
We worked with the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), covering over four decades of terrorist activity worldwide. Here’s a glimpse of what we analyzed:

-📅 Year – From 1970 to 2017.
-🌍 Country & Region – Where each attack took place.
-💣 Attack Type – From bombings to armed assaults.
-🔫 Weapon Type – What was used in each incident.
-🎯 Target Type – Who or what was being attacked.
-🧨 Victims – People killed and wounded.
-🕵️ Perpetrator Group – When known, who was behind it.

## 📈 Key Findings
Here are some powerful insights we uncovered. Some expected, some shocking:

✅ More than 200 countries have suffered at least one terrorist attack. Terrorism is not a local problem, it is a global threat that has left its mark even in countries considered safe.  
✅ Just 3 countries account for nearly half of the world's victims: Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan top the list, painting a clear picture of the global hot zones.  
✅ Terrorism saw a massive surge around 2010/2011 until 2014, when it started to decline.  
✅ Despite the increase in attacks, since 2007 the success rate of these attacks has been steadily decreasing. This reflects global awareness and the improvement of prevention and defenses in many countries.  
✅ Civilians are the most frequent targets (this isn’t just a military problem).  
✅ Explosives are by far the most used weapon type, causing twice as many victims as the second most used weapon type, armed assaults.  
✅ It is important to differentiate between recurrence and lethality: the Taliban are the group that commits the most attacks worldwide, but ISIL is the one that causes the most deaths.
