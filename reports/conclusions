üì¢ Key Insights from Global Terrorism Analysis

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Most terrorist attacks occurred between 2010 and 2014, with a peak around 2014. However, since 2006 the success rates of the attacks have been falling.
This period saw a rise in global terrorism, driven largely by the emergence and intensification of conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, such as the rise of ISIS and increased activity by Boko Haram. On the other hand, more number attacks does not mean they are successful, as since 2006 the succes rate decreased from 0.96 to 0.8.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Although the success rate is falling nowadays, it is still very high, raising concerns about the effectiveness of global prevention measures.
The high success rate of attacks suggests vulnerabilities in security infrastructure, especially in conflict-prone or politically unstable regions.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are the top three countries with the highest number of victims.
These countries have suffered the greatest human toll from terrorist activity, indicating a persistent regional instability (like in the Middle East) and the influence of long-term armed conflicts.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Although a large number of incidents are labeled as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù in terms of the perpetrating group, the top five identified groups account for more than 60% of all known victims.
There are so many attacks worldwide that are not attributed to any group, which reinforces the need for improved tracking systems for anonymous incidents. However, only the Talibanes, ISIL, Shining Path, Al-Shabaab and New Peoples Army committed more than 60%, which underlinesthe importance of tracking and countering their activity across regions.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Explosives are the most commonly used weapon in terrorist attacks worldwide, mostly towards civilians.
This idea suggest that terrorists have a clear preference for attacks that have a high impact, not discerning between the targets and spreading psychological fear (however is not the most lethal type of attack). In addition, the fact that civilians are the most common target reinforces this idea of indiscriminate attacks.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ The invisible victims: regions without media focus, such as Somalia or Yemen.
Countries like Somalia, Yemen, or Mali suffer thousands of deaths from terrorism each year, yet they barely appear in the media. The inequality in coverage creates a biased narrative of the problem.

üöÄ Final Thoughts
This project sheds light on the global spread and impact of terrorism, identifying key trends in geography, strategy, and actor behavior. The findings point to a need for targeted counterterrorism efforts focused on high-impact regions and groups. Future analyses could deepen the focus by exploring political motivations, social consequences, or network-based relationships among terrorist organizations.
